# Fingerprint Browser v1 Design Baseline

This package is the first architecture baseline for a personal Rust fingerprint-browser manager using GPUI Kit, fingerprint-chromium and Xray.

## Files

- `architecture.md` — system boundaries, workspace, dependency direction and runtime architecture.
- `domain-model.md` — core Rust domain types and persistent/ephemeral state separation.
- `service-contracts.md` — repository, planner, supervisor and runtime interfaces.
- `lifecycle.md` — browser/Xray startup, rollback, stop and crash state machine.
- `implementation-plan.md` — phased implementation order and first test matrix.
- `Cargo.workspace.example.toml` — workspace skeleton only; dependency versions are resolved during implementation.

## Decisions fixed for v1

1. Rust desktop application with GPUI Kit.
2. Existing fingerprint-chromium is the browser engine; no Chromium fork in v1.
3. SQLite local storage.
4. One Xray process per running proxied profile.
5. Stable seed + explicit persona fields; avoid a large legacy fingerprint field matrix.
6. UI never owns child processes.
7. RuntimeSupervisor is the single owner of Chromium/Xray process handles.
8. Profile configuration and RuntimeSession are separate models.
9. CDP is loopback-only and used for readiness/basic control, not an automation platform.
10. Xray failure closes the corresponding Chromium session (fail closed).

## Next implementation step

Batch 1 should create the actual Cargo workspace and compile-only skeleton for all five crates, then implement the domain types, errors, runtime command/event types and the minimum GPUI window.
